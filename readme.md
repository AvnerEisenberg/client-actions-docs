# CPI Node Client Actions

## Introduction
The CPI Node allows addons to perform client actions within events. 

These actions are implemented by the clients.

This is the documentation of these actions.

## Client Actions
This a list of the client actions:

* [Dialog](actions/dialog.md)
* [Scan Barcode](actions/scan-barcode.md)
* [Geo Location](actions/geo-location.md)
* [HUD](actions/hud.md)
* [Navigation](actions/navigation.md)
* [Load Page](actions/load-page.md)
* [Load Legacy Page](actions/load-legacy-page.md)


## Contributing
Each client action is documented in a seperate file, in the actions folder.
[This](action-template.md) is a template of how a client action should be documented.
To add a new client action you add a new file, and add the action to the list below

Every action must undergo a Pull Request review process. Before merging the action into the repo, the action must be reviewed by the at least two members with design knowledge.
