## Usage
We can show a HUD from the CPI Node like one of the following example.

```typescript

const hudOptions = {
    // HUD's message
    message: 'Waiting....', // optional (default value is '')

    // adds a button with text to the HUD
    cancelMessage: 'Press to close', // optional - (default is '' and the botton is hidden)

    //display the HUD after the delay time (the block runs in the meantime)
    delay: 0.2, //optional - (default value is 0.5)

    //tell the client to poll after after the interval time
    interval: 0.1, // optional - (default value is 0.5)

    // NOTE, inside both block and cancelBlock, you can't call another client actions.
    // block of code that will run in background while the HUD is showing.
    block: async (updateMessage) => {
        // do stuff that takes a long time that needs a HUD
        // for example
        for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
            // you can update the HUD message while the HUD is showing
            updateMessage(`In progress ${i}%`);
        }
    },
    // block of code that will run after the user pressed on the HUD'S cancel button.
    cancelBlock: async () => {
        console.log('cancel button clicked');
    },
};

await pepperi.client.showHUD(hudOptions);
```
